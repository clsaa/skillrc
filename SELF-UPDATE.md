# SELF-UPDATE.md — Self-Iteration Playbook

## Purpose

You were told to self-iterate this repo. Follow this playbook to refresh existing entries and discover new useful tools, then commit.

This file is the **update** mode; it is the counterpart to [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), which is the **install** mode. `AGENTS.md` tells an agent how to read the manifest and install skills into its own environment. `SELF-UPDATE.md` tells an agent how to maintain the manifest itself — re-verify what's already here and add what's missing — so the next agent that reads `AGENTS.md` gets accurate, current data.

## A. Refresh existing entries

First check `curl -s https://api.github.com/rate_limit`. If you are rate-limited, STOP and ask the user to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` — never guess or estimate a star count (that violates §C).

For every skill listed in [`skills/INDEX.md`](./skills/INDEX.md) and its corresponding `skills/*.md` file:

1. Extract the `owner/repo` from the file's `Repo:` line and call the GitHub API:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}
   ```
2. Update the `Stars:` field from the response's `stargazers_count`, rounded to ~Nk (e.g. `stargazers_count: 245231` → `~245k`).
3. If the response is `Not Found` (404), the repo has `"archived": true`, or the repo has moved/renamed (the API returns a different `full_name` than expected, or a redirect), **flag it — do not silently delete it**:
   - Add a `> ⚠️ status: <what you found, and the date>` note directly under the title in the `skills/<slug>.md` file.
   - Add the same `⚠️` marker to that skill's row in the `skills/INDEX.md` compatibility matrix.
4. Re-read the repo's README or homepage (whichever the entry links to) to confirm the `Compatibility:` claims (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode) still hold. If a symbol changed, update it in both the `skills/<slug>.md` file and the matching `skills/INDEX.md` row — they must stay identical, per `CONTRIBUTING.md`. A compatibility claim taken only from an upstream README/prose is `⚠️` at most. Reserve `✅` for compatibility you (or the manifest) actually confirmed by a successful install/dry-run.
5. Update every `as of YYYY-MM` stamp you touched — in the entry file, the `skills/INDEX.md` footer, and `README.md` — to the current month.

## B. Discover new tools

Discovery is a concrete, repeatable step — not freehand browsing. Run the discovery helper first, then curate its output.

### B.1 Generate a candidate list

```bash
bash scripts/discover.sh          # optional args: MIN_STARS (default 500) TOP_N (default 25)
# set GITHUB_TOKEN to avoid Search API rate limits
```

`scripts/discover.sh` does the mechanical part deterministically:

1. Builds the "already have" set from every `skills/*.md` `Repo:` line.
2. Queries the GitHub Search API across several angles (`topic:agent-skills`, `topic:claude-code`, `SKILL.md` in readme, etc.).
3. Diffs candidates against the have-set (case-insensitive) so nothing already in the manifest reappears.
4. Applies a relevance gate (name/topics/description must be about skills / coding agents) and prints the survivors ranked by stars, with a `[desc:multi]` / `[desc:1-agent]` hint (description-derived only — see the triage rules in §B.2).

It deliberately does **not** edit anything — discovery is separate from curation.

### B.2 Curate the candidates

Keep only candidates that fit two constraints at once:

- **Repo scope:** cross-agent tools that work across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode (prefer `[desc:multi]` rows; take single-agent tools only if exceptionally notable).
- **Maintainer profile:** AI / system-architecture / full-stack — favor tools that extend those three hats, like the existing "Extra picks".

**Triage rules — rejecting takes the same rigor as adding.** (Post-mortem: ponytail and caveman were wrongly skipped in the 2026-07-04 run on description-derived signals; both turned out to be verified cross-agent.)

1. The `[desc:*]` hint comes from the repo's description/topics only and is frequently wrong — caveman's description said "Claude Code skill" while its INSTALL.md documents 30+ agents. Use the hint to order your review, **never** as a reason to reject.
2. Before rejecting any candidate with more stars than the lowest-starred entry already in the manifest, open its README/INSTALL and check its actual agent-support docs. Do not judge by tone — meme-flavored repos can carry real, verified utility.
3. Record every deep-checked rejection in the **Triage log** at the bottom of `skills/INDEX.md` (repo, date, one-line reason). Consult that log at the start of each run: logged rejections need no re-review unless the repo materially changed; an unlogged skip was never really reviewed.

For each candidate you keep:

1. Verify its star count via the GitHub API (never estimate) and its compatibility by actually reading its docs/README (never assume the `[desc:*]` hint — it's only a heuristic from the description). A compatibility claim taken only from an upstream README/prose is `⚠️` at most. Reserve `✅` for compatibility you (or the manifest) actually confirmed by a successful install/dry-run.
2. Create `skills/<slug>.md` (or `skills/extra-<slug>.md` for a supplementary pick) from the entry template in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, filled in completely.
3. Add exactly one row to the correct table in `skills/INDEX.md`, following `CONTRIBUTING.md` step 3.
4. If you added or removed any entries, update the `skills-N core + M extra` count in the `README.md` badge to match.

The helper only covers the GitHub Search API. Also skim these curated catalogs, which surface things search ranks poorly — several are already directory entries in this manifest: `VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills`, `addyosmani/agent-skills`, `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`, and skills.sh.

## C. Guardrails

- Star counts must come from the live GitHub API — never invent or estimate a number.
- Keep the exact entry template from `CONTRIBUTING.md` — same fields, same order, same labels.
- Add **at most 5 new skills per run**, and list each one in the changelog entry.
- Prefer cross-agent tools (works across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) over single-agent-only tools.
- When unsure whether a tool belongs in the main tables, do not add it there — add it to a `## Candidates (needs human review)` section at the bottom of `skills/INDEX.md` instead, with the repo link and a one-line reason for the uncertainty.

## D. Consistency check

Before committing, run the same structural checks used elsewhere in this repo:

```bash
# every INDEX link resolves to a file
grep -oE '\(\./([a-z0-9-]+)\.md\)' skills/INDEX.md | sed 's/[()]//g; s/^\.\///' | while read f; do test -f "skills/$f" || echo "BROKEN LINK: $f"; done

# every skill file has all template fields
for f in skills/*.md; do
  [ "$f" = "skills/INDEX.md" ] && continue
  grep -q "Compatibility:" "$f" && grep -q "Install:" "$f" && grep -q "Verify:" "$f" && grep -q "Stars:" "$f" || echo "MISSING FIELDS: $f"
done

# no placeholder leftovers anywhere
grep -rn "TBD\|TODO\|FIXME\|<command>\|<symbol>\|<category>" skills/ && echo "PLACEHOLDER FOUND" || echo "clean"
```

Expected: no "BROKEN LINK" lines, no "MISSING FIELDS" lines, and "clean" printed.

Then run the full end-to-end suite as the authoritative gate (it re-runs the checks above plus repo-liveness and install-command validation):

```bash
bash tests/e2e.sh          # set GITHUB_TOKEN to avoid API rate limits
```

Expected: `E2E OK` (exit 0). If it reports `FAIL`, fix before committing. Star-drift `WARN`s are the signal that this self-iterate run should update those numbers.

## D.5 Confirm before committing

Before committing, present the user a summary of what changed — files touched, the draft CHANGELOG entry, and any newly added skills — and get explicit go-ahead. Do not commit sweeping manifest changes unreviewed.

## E. Record + commit

1. Prepend a new dated entry to the top of [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) (newest first) summarizing:
   - stars updated (count),
   - repos flagged (list, with reason),
   - skills added (list, with links).
2. Commit with message:
   ```
   chore: self-iterate manifest (YYYY-MM-DD)
   ```
   using the actual date the run happened.
