#
# discover.sh — surface NEW candidate skills for a SELF-UPDATE.md run.
#
# What it does (deterministic, repeatable):
#   1. Builds the "already have" set from every skills/*.md Repo: line.
#   2. Queries the GitHub Search API across several angles (topics + keywords
#      that agent-skill repos use).
#   3. Diffs candidates against the have-set (case-insensitive) so nothing
#      already in the manifest is re-surfaced.
#   4. Prints the new candidates ranked by stars, with a cross-agent hint.
#
# It does NOT edit the manifest — discovery is separate from curation. A human
# or an agent running SELF-UPDATE.md §B reviews the list, verifies each pick,
# and adds at most 5 (per the guardrails).
#
# Usage:   bash scripts/discover.sh [MIN_STARS] [TOP_N]
#          MIN_STARS default 500, TOP_N default 25.
# Network: requires GitHub API access. Set GITHUB_TOKEN to avoid rate limits
#          (Search API is only ~10 req/min unauthenticated).
# Deps:    curl, python3 (both present on macOS and ubuntu CI runners).

NOTE: [desc:*] hints reflect the repo's description/topics ONLY. Real agent
support often lives in README/INSTALL docs the hint cannot see. Prioritize
with hints; reject only after opening the repo (SELF-UPDATE.md §B.2).

Next (SELF-UPDATE.md §B): for each candidate you want to keep —
  1. Confirm it's genuinely new and in-scope (cross-agent, fits the profile).
  2. Verify stars + compatibility via the GitHub API / its README (never assume).
  3. Add it via the CONTRIBUTING template; uncertain picks -> "Candidates" section.
  4. Cap at 5 new skills per run.
