# skills/INDEX.md — Master Manifest & Compatibility Matrix

This is the machine-readable manifest for the Agent Onboarding Kit: it lists every curated skill, its category, its compatibility with each target agent, its star count, and a link to its detail page. Agents should read this file to decide what to install (see `AGENTS.md` for the full procedure).

## Legend

- ✅ — supported
- ⚠️ — works but not officially documented
- ❌ — not supported

## ⚠️ Resource note — multi-agent fan-out

Some picks dispatch **parallel sub-agents** (review panels, parallel investigators, design variants). That multiplies token cost and latency — enable them deliberately, not for small or sequential edits:

- **Superpowers** (core #1) — `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `subagent-driven-development`
- **gstack** (extra #10) — multi-role review agents + `design-shotgun` (**heaviest** here; use `qa-only` / single `review` for small work)
- **wshobson Agents** (extra #14) — the `agent-teams` / `agent-orchestration` plugins (other plugins are fine)
- **caveman** (extra #9) — `cavecrew` sub-agents, but net token-**saving** (it compresses output)

## Extra picks

Opinionated extras oriented toward AI, architecture, and full-stack work. The core 10 above already cover those three areas — AI: Context Engineering (#7), Composio/MCP (#8); architecture: Superpowers (#1), Planning with Files (#6); full-stack: Vercel (#5), MiniMax (#3), Antfu (#9). The picks below extend those.

## Triage log (reviewed, not added)

Deep-checked candidates rejected with a dated reason, so future self-iterate runs neither re-review them needlessly nor re-skip others on weak signals (see `SELF-UPDATE.md` §B.2). A logged rejection may be revisited if the repo materially changes.

- [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) — 2026-07-09 — removed from Extra picks. **Installing it is not recommended.** Problems observed in use:
  - **Over-slices complex tasks.** The 7-rung "decision ladder" runs before every change and biases toward the *minimum viable implementation*, so complex/architectural work gets chopped into many small iterations — more agent round-trips, longer overall completion time, and (despite each diff being smaller) more total tokens spent on the extra steps.
  - **Benchmarks don't generalize.** Upstream's headline numbers (−54% LOC, −27% time) are `n=4` on a single FastAPI+React repo with Haiku 4.5; the repo itself notes gains are "near-zero where code is already minimal" and large only in "over-building traps." There's no evidence of benefit on complex tasks, where the ladder overhead can be net-negative.
  - **Always-on YAGNI bias.** The ruleset is injected into every task (and into subagents via a regex matcher). Applied indiscriminately it can under-build genuinely needed structure and defer necessary work — it even ships `/ponytail-debt` to later harvest the shortcuts it accumulates.
  - **Operational cost & trust surface.** Requires Node.js on PATH and runs lifecycle hooks on Claude Code / Codex / Devin (code execution on every turn); mode is process-local, so on shared gateways `/ponytail` must be restricted to trusted users.
- [claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) — 2026-07-11 — Anthropic's official plugin marketplace, but Claude Code-only and mixes MCP servers/plugins (with an explicit trust caveat); manifest prefers cross-agent and already carries `anthropics/skills`.
- [obsidian-skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills) — 2026-07-11 — clean cross-agent (CC/Codex/OpenCode) Agent-Skills pack, but domain-specific to Obsidian note-taking, outside this manifest's dev-workflow profile.
- [claude-code-templates](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates) — 2026-07-11 — Claude Code-only CLI/config system (agents/commands/MCPs/hooks), not a cross-agent skill pack.
- [agentskills/agentskills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) — 2026-07-11 — the Agent Skills spec/registry hub (agentskills.io), a standard + client showcase, not an installable skill pack itself.

- [Agent-Reach](https://github.com/Panniantong/Agent-Reach) — 2026-07-04 — web-access CLI/MCP tooling, not a SKILL.md-style skill (out of scope).
- [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — 2026-07-04 — Claude Code-only (`.claude` conventions); manifest prefers cross-agent.
- [get-shit-done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) — 2026-07-04 — Claude Code-only system; manifest prefers cross-agent.

- [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) — 2026-07-05 — generic CLI proxy binary (token compression), out-of-scope category despite broad agent hooks.

- [CowAgent](https://github.com/zhayujie/CowAgent) — 2026-07-05 — self-described agent harness with multi-channel runtime.
